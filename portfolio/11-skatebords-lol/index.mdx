A group project at Hyper Island. An e-comerce skateboard shop where one can buy decks, trunks, wheels, or a whole skateboard.

The project was build with Next.js for the front end. We chose that for the option to get SSR for what could be a long list of everything we were going to sell on the store, instead to rendering everything on the clients browser. The back end was written in Express.js to be able to keep writing Javascript for it.

I worked on building parts of the API, writing tests in Mocha and Chai for the back end, and working on the Products list page and the cart.
