A design of a coffee timer for the Apple Watch to help with the timing of your brews. The goal was to design something in the middle of apps where you change every setting and eye balling the measurements.

This app helps you figure out the ratios for water and coffee and the timing of your brews. There are different settings depending on brewing method: V60, Chemex, Aeropress, French press, or Siphon. You can also use it for regular brews, cold brews, or ice brews. You can also save your favourites as shortcuts.
