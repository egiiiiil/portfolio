While the game is not finished, play the games as someone stranded on an island and escape from the island by solving the challenges. The challenges are shown a Circuit Playground with lights and sound and the answers are entered in the game.

The project was built with A-Frame and React. I chose to base it on React so that I could split the code into components while working on the project, and A-Frame to get the 3D environment working easily.

The 3D models are from [Poly.pizza](https://poly.pizza/) so that I didn't need to make them my self.
