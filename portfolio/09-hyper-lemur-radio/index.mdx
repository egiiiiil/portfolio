[Live version](https://hyper-lemur-radio.vercel.app/)

A small web player for live channels from Radio Sweden built with React. Using `createContext()` to send the picked channel from the list to the player.

```
<MediaPlayerContext.Provider
  value={{
    channelList,
    setChannelList,
    pickedchannel,
    setPickedchannel,
	}}
	>
  {children}
</MediaPlayerContext.Provider>
```

This made sending the picked channel to the player easy. The player itself is a standard `<audio>` tag and the channel image.
