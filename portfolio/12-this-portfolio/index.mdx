I made the portfolio with a folder structure like this:

```
Portfolio
├──/portfolio
│  ├──/01
│  │  ├──index.mdx
│  │  └──index.png
│  ├──/02
│  └──/03
└──/srs
   ├──/components
   ├──/image
   │  └──/itemImage
   ├──/pages
   │  ├──/404
   │  ├──/portfolio
   │  └──index.js
   └──/utils
      └──indexSwitch.js
```

It made it easy to separate the code from the content and if I have to change how I store the content it wouldn't require a lot of code changes.

I chose not to really have a CMS but just use `.mdx` files to have the site easy to keep updated without having to have a database. For a site this size it was enough with markdown files with some meta data for the content.
